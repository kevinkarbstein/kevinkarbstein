## Hi there 👋

My name is Kevin - I'm a PostDoc at Friedrich Schiller University of Jena and the Florida Museum of Natural History of the University of Florida. 
I previously worked and studied at the University of Göttingen, Technical University of Ilmenau, and Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.
My research interests cover phylogenomics, morphometrics, and integrative taxonomy, 🌱 with a particular focus on polyploidy, hybridization, and asexuality in plants.
🔭 Recently, I've been diving into pipeline programming and deep learning approaches. 

I'm always happy to collaborate! 📫 Send me an email at either kevin.karbstein at uni-jena.de or k.karbstein at ufl.edu.


Some of my recent projects:


- [LazyModeler](https://github.com/KK260/LazyModeler): LazyModeler is a statistical package for the programming language R that allows for easy performance of regression modeling

- [GenomeXtract](https://github.com/KK260/GenomeXtract): Automatically download, filter, and assemble genomes (or genes) from NCBI
