## Hi there 👋

My name is Kevin - I'm a PostDoc at Friedrich Schiller University of Jena and the Florida Museum of Natural History of the University of Florida. 
I previously worked and studied at the University of Göttingen, Technical University of Ilmenau, and Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.
My research interests cover phylogenomics, morphometrics, and integrative taxonomy, 🌱 with a particular focus on polyploidy, hybridization, and asexuality in plants.
🔭 Recently, I've been diving into pipeline programming and deep learning approaches. 

I'm always happy to collaborate! 📫 Send me an email at either kevin.karbstein@uni-jena.de or k.karbstein@ufl.edu.
